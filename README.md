The server computer must downlaod all the code, but the client players only need the client program.
The server must be started first, and then the clients can connect after.
In the client program, you must set the IP to the IP of the server's computer,

After that starts, you can start to play the game. The size of the game is 5 by 5. You play until one of the players map is entirely zeros.
The player that has all zero has lost.
In order to restart the game, you must restart the server and two clients.
